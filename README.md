# Data-Structutres-Using-MATLAB

This repository has various Data structures that can be used in daily computation. We have tried to illustrate the concepts using MATLAB. The developments expected to follow soon. 


The repository includes:
1. Taylor Series Expansion to estimate expoenential value
2. Truncation Error
